| I just opened an R script for you, and I have loaded a dataset called `worldcup`. For this question, you
| will be adding a function from `dplyr` or `tidyr` to the pipe chain in the script. Your goal is to
| re-create the example output shown in the comments of the script. When you are ready to submit your script,
| save the script and type `submit()`, or type `reset()` to reset the script to its original state.

| In this question, you will continue to build on the data cleaning you started in the last question. I
| opened a new R script for you with the previous question completed. As a next step, you now need to reduce
| the data frame to show the mean of each column selected in the previous step. To do this, add a function
| from `dplyr` or `tidyr` to the pipe chain in the script. Your goal is to re-create the example output shown
| in the comments of the script. When you are ready to submit your script, save the script and type
| `submit()`, or type `reset()` to reset the script to its original state.

| In this question, you will again continue to build on the data cleaning you started in the last two
| questions. I opened a new R script for you with the previous steps completed. As a next step, you now need
| to rearrange the data frame to have one column with each variable's name and one column with mean values
| for each variable. To do this, add a function from `dplyr` or `tidyr` to the pipe chain in the script. Your
| goal is to re-create the example output shown in the comments of the script. When you are ready to submit
| your script, save the script and type `submit()`, or type `reset()` to reset the script to its original
| state.

| In this question, you will continue to build on the data cleaning in the last three questions. I opened a
| new R script for you with the previous steps completed. As a next step, you now round the mean values to
| one decimal point. To do this, add a function from `dplyr` or `tidyr` to the pipe chain in the script. Your
| goal is to re-create the example output shown in the comments of the script. When you are ready to submit
| your script, save the script and type `submit()`, or type `reset()` to reset the script to its original

| In this question, we'll be doing similar data cleaning with a new dataset. I have loaded a dataset called
| `titanic` for you. For this question, you need to subset the original dataframe down to four columns. Your
| goal is to re-create the example output shown in the comments of the script by adding a `dplyr` or `tidyr`
| function to the pipe chain.  When you are ready to submit your script, save the script and type `submit()`,
| or type `reset()` to reset the script to its original state.

| In this question, you will continue to build on the data cleaning you started in the last question. I
| opened a new R script for you with the previous question completed. As a next step, you now need to remove
| any observations that are missing a value for Age. To do this, add a function from `dplyr` or `tidyr` to
| the pipe chain in the script. Your goal is to re-create the example output shown in the comments of the
| script. When you are ready to submit your script, save the script and type `submit()`, or type `reset()` to
| reset the script to its original state.

| In this question, you will again continue to build on the data cleaning you started in the last two
| questions. I opened a new R script for you with the previous steps completed. As a next step, you now need
| to create a new column called agecat that divides a person's age into three broad categories (Under 15, 15
| to 50, Over 50). To do this, add a function from `dplyr` or `tidyr` to the pipe chain in the script. Your
| goal is to re-create the example output shown in the comments of the script. When you are ready to submit
| your script, save the script and type `submit()`, or type `reset()` to reset the script to its original

| In this question, you will continue to build on the data cleaning you from the last three questions. I
| opened a new R script for you with the previous steps completed. As a next step, you now need to generate a
| data frame with the number of passengers, number of survivors, and percent survival stratified by passenger
| class, age category, and sex. To do this, add one or more functions from `dplyr` or `tidyr` to the pipe
| chain in the script. Your goal is to re-create the example output shown in the comments of the script. When
| you are ready to submit your script, save the script and type `submit()`, or type `reset()` to reset the
